# eBOSSDR16QSOE
eBOSS DR16 Quasar sample with enhanced systematic weights

This repository will host the data presented in [Rezaie et al. MNRAS (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13724), and it will be made public soon upon the acceptance of the paper and its companion papers. Here are the measured monopole of the eBOSS DR16 Quasars in the NGC and SGC with 0.8<z<2.2 relative to the LCDM Universe with $`f_{NL}=0`$. The errorbars are estimated from 1000 synthetic catalogs:
